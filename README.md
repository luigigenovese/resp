 ReSParse library API project
=============================

In this project we would like to define the API for the ReSParse
linear algebra library.

The instruction for generate and verfiy the API are the following

 * Install [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/)
 * Add the tool [Sphinx-fortran](http://sphinx-fortran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/http://sphinx-fortran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
 which is needed for the interpretation of the API from Fortran files
 * Clone the repository and compile the documentation via <tt>make html</tt>
 * The documentation can be then opened by a browser in <tt>build/html/index.html</tt>
 * The files to be modified are then of two types:
  * [reStructured Text](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html) ; see for example the file <tt>source/index.rst</tt> or <tt>source/sparsematrix.rst</tt>. Here the documentation is presented and referenced from the autodoc generated by
  * Fortran files, like for example the file <tt>resp.f90</tt>. Here the API is directly written in fortran format, such that the objects can be referenced from the <tt>.rst</tt> files.
